# JK question: we need to write out what our sampling frame is and why we decided on that.
#JN- I should have done this from the start but put all communities on imported excel sheet 1 and will exclude using R so it is
#reproducible/easier to follow.

#sampling frame: direct element sampling from all communities listed in the most recent census obtained form AA health network
  #excluding: large urban areas as they have low likelihood of having trachoma. 
    #Specifically the capital cities/towns: Yurimaguas, Jeberos, Balsapuerto, Santa Cruz, Lagunas.

  #also excluding: health posts that are on the road from Tarapoto to Yurimaguas as the communities they serve are peri-urban and 
  #thus have a low likelihood of having trachoma. 
  #Based on GPS coordinates of health posts https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O5X0jLKe0MhXjf9rfm2DOett0qgsN-4S&usp=sharing
  #the health posts excluded so far are makred with red pins on the maps
    #Specifically: 30 de agosto Km 17, Santo Tomas, san juan de pamploma, Grau km 40, Pampa Hermosa, INDEPENDENCIA DEL SHANUSI,
    #Cotoyacu, Puerto Peru, Independencia, Tupac Amaru

  #JN question: we also could exclude health posts on the road from Yurimaguas to Balsapuerto, what do you think?
    #specifically these would be the health posts of: Munichis, Santa Lucia, and ACHUAL LIMON.
    #I have not excluded these yet, will ask Mu√±oz about it.

#Answered Questions:

# JK - As of now it appears to be 5 (6)? districts, excluding Yurimaguas. JN-5 districts is correct
# JK - What is the Balsa/Yurimaguas designation? JN-Health posts on the border, I believe serving communities from both districts
# JK - Are there places in Yurimaguas that are smaller that we should not be excluding?
#JN-there probably are, I can review the entire list with the epidemiologist in AA

# JK- Did MOH tell you to exclude all of Yurimaguas. 
#JN- this was after a conversation with Willy as it is a more developped area, lots of peri urban communities,
#roads, cars. However when I talked to Durand he said Lagunas or Balsapuerto districts would be our best bet.
